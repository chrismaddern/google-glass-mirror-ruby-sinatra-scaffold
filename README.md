# Google Glass Mirror API Ruby / Sinatra Template App

Scaffold for creating Google Glass Mirror API apps in Ruby on Sinatra. 
This was created while making Facebook for Glass - https://facebookglass.herokuapp.com and makes it simple to connect to Glass and one other service and to send items from Glass to that other service.

## Getting Started

This project relies on a local Postgres database. 
Create a local database and head in to `config/database.yml` to configure the app for your database.

Fire it up:
`bundle exec unicorn`

You should see something like this:

Now at the top of `application.rb`, edit the following:

  ```ruby
  APP_NAME        = "YOUR_APP_NAME"
  APP_IMAGE_URL   = "YOUR_APP_IMAGE_URL"
  SERVICE_NAME    = "SERVICE_NAME"

  set :bucket,      'YOUR_S3_BUCKET'
  set :s3_key,      'YOUR_S3_KEY'
  set :s3_secret,   'YOUR_S3_SECRET'
  ```
Open `helpers/yourservicehelper.rb` and implement the following methods:

```ruby
  def service_auth_url
  def service_auth_object # an oauth object representing the connection to the service you're using
  def share_action(img_url, access_token)
  def share_action_video(img_url, access_token)
```

You should now have a very basic Glass application that will authorize with Glass & your service and can start implementing new features!
